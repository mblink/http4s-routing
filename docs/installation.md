The `routing-core` package provides simple, type-safe, and framework-agnostic forward and reverse routing for HTTP
applications. To get started, add the following to your SBT configuration:

```scala
resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("bondlink", "routing")
libraryDependencies += "bondlink" %% "routing-core" % "@VERSION@"
```
