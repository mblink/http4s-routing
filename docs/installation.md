The `routing-core` package provides simple, type-safe, and framework-agnostic forward and reverse routing for HTTP
applications. To get started, add the following to your SBT configuration:

```scala
resolvers += "bondlink-maven-repo" at "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mblink/maven-repo/main"
libraryDependencies += "bondlink" %% "routing-core" % "@VERSION@"
```
